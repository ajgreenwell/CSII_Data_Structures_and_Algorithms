# CSII_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

This is a collection of all the scripts I have written throughout _Computer Science II_, a java-based course focusing on data structures and algorithms. Some projects apps, which implement common Abstract Data Types (ADT) to solve some problem. Other projects involve writing those ADT implementations on my own.
